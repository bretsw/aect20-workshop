# Background on R and RStudio

---

# Why learn R?

--

- It is increasingly used in education

--

- It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

--

- It is a programming language and quite flexible

--

- It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses

--

- It is able to work with data small (*n* = 10) and large (*n* = 1,000,000+) efficiently

--

- There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers

# Where You'll Be Running R

RStudio Cloud (preferred)  
OR  
R + RStudio locally on your computer  

---

# Option 1: RStudio Cloud

[`Workshop Project Space in RStudio Cloud`](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1820768)
- Link also here: https://rstudio.cloud/project/1820768

--

- Once you have navigated to this webpage, log in using a Google or GitHub account. 

--

- Then, create a permanent copy of the project in your own workspace (see the prompt at the top of the page guiding you to do this).

--

- From here, you can write and run R code exactly as you would through RStudio on your computer.

---

# Option 2: R + RStudio Locally

### To download R

- Visit [**cran.r-project.org**](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download R
- Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

### To download RStudio

- Visit [**rstudio.com**](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to download RStudio
- Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

# Getting started with RStudio

Activities:  

1. Running a single RMarkdown chunk  
1. Running another RMarkdown chunk  
1. Rendering an RMarkdown document to a PDF  
1. Creating your first visualization

---

# RMarkdown

* RMarkdown is a data analysis "notebook" that combines text with code and output
* It is a great file type to use when beginning to use R and to create reproducible analyses
* It is fun to use because you can generate different types of output (Word, PDF, and even web-based)

# Looking at code

What do you think this code will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
starwars %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>% 
  select(name, hair_color, skin_color, homeworld)
```

---

# Looking at code

Let's see!

```{r, eval = TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>% 
  select(name, hair_color, skin_color, homeworld)
```

What do you think this code will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

  arrange(desc(height)) %>%
  select(name, sex, height, mass, homeworld)
