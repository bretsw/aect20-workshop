# Objectives

Big goal: Support you to have confidence that you can solve the data analysis and data science-related problems you 
wish to solve. 

Specific goals:

- Get up and running and know how to navigate R and RStudio
- Know enough to get started witht he following:
	- Visualize and explore data
	- Statistically analyze data
	- Prepare messy data
	- Explore some of the more data science-y aspects of R through text analysis
- Develop confidence going forward in you ability to analyze data as a part of your program

---

# Pedagogical framework

*Constructivist*

You'll be involved in the process of building new capabilities (and knowledge and skills) with support from others and carefully-chosen scaffolds (and tools).

Specifically: 

- Each of the four sessions will be organized around a big idea
- You will be doing a great deal of the work
1. You'll be using R Markdown to try things out
1. There will be some "reach" challenges for you to consider; you'll also have the chance for greater support
- Then, we will discuss what we did and how it applies

---

# Over-arching design of today's session

The pedagogical framework play out in the following specific ways:

1. You'll have the chance to share your ideas
1. You'll first see some brief examples to give you a sense of what's possible
  - You'll be using R Markdown to try things out
  - There will be some "reach" challenges for you to consider
  - You'll also have the chance for greater support
1. You'll have another chance to share your ideas and thoughts about what you've done; it will also give me a chance to hear from you about what you did

# Agenda

### *Part 1: Getting up and running*
### Part 2: Visualizing and exploring data
### Part 3: Modeling and understanding data
### Part 4: Doing more with data science

# Background on R and RStudio

---

# A little motivation theory

## Expectancy-value theory

We choose things that we are *confident* that we can do well and that are *valuable* to us

We do these in a sociocultural *context*: our sense of belonging impacts what we choose to do

## An argument about RMarkdown

- This presentation will make the argument that **you can use R and RStudio to solve
problems that are important to you**

- In doing so, you can **participate in a cool community of data scientists in education**

--- 

# Why learn R?

* It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses
* It is able to work with data small (*n* = 30) and large (*n* = 100,000+) efficiently
* It is a programming language and so is quite flexible
* There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers (and teachers)
* It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

# Prerequisites

---

# RStudio Cloud

**[This link will take you to the RStudio Cloud project for this workshop](https://rstudio.cloud/project/964811).**

Once you have navigated to this webpage, log in using a Google or GitHub account. Then, create a permanent copy of the project in your own workspace (see the prompt at the top of the page guiding you to do this).

From here, you can write and run R code exactly as your would through RStudio on your computer.
---

# R and RStudio

**If you like, you may (of course!) use R and RStudio**

If not downloaded:

To download R:
* [Visit this page to download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
* Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

To download RStudio:
* [Visit this page to download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
* Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

### Check that it worked

Open RStudio. Find the console window and type in `2 + 2`. If what you can guess is returned (hint: it's what you expect!), then RStudio *and* R both work.
