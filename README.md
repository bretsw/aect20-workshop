# Background

## Objectives

Big goal: Be confident that you can solve the data analysis and data science-related problems you 
wish to solve. 

Specific goals; session participants will be able to:

- Get up and running and know how to navigate RStudio
- Know enough to get started:
	- Visualize and explore data
	- Statistically analyze data
	- Prepare messy data
	- Explore some of the more data science-y aspects of R through text analysis
- Develop confidence going forward in the ability to analyze data as a part of your program

## Pedagogical framework 

I take a constructivist approach; this means that you'll be involved in the process of building new capabilities (and knowledge and skills) with support from others and carefully-chosen scaffolds (and tools).

- Each of the four sessions will be organized around a big idea
- You will be doing a great deal of the work
- tTen, we will discuss what we did and how it applies

This will play out in the following specific ways:

1. You'll have the chance to share your ideas
1. You'll first see some brief examples to give you a sense of what's possible
1. You'll be using R Markdown to try things out
1. There will be some "reach" challenges for you to consider; you'll also have the chance for greater support
1. You'll have another chance to share your ideas and thoughts about what you've done; it will also give me a chance to hear from you about what you did

The big ideas are as follows:

- Getting up and running
- Visualizing and exploring data
- Modeling and understanding data
- Doing more with data science

# Plan

- Running another chunk
- Rendering a document

## 2. Data Visualization and Data Exploration

- Bar chart
- Scatterplot
  - Adding a line of best fit
  
- Viewing data
- Counting

- Colors
- Filtering
- Selecting
- Theming
- Saving plots

## 3. Modeling and preparing data
