Let's first load the {dataedu} package adn the {tidyverse} suite of packages.

```{r}
library(dataedu)
library(tidyverse)
```

If you saw some messages, success!

Here is the data set we will use:

```{r}
sci_mo_processed
```

# Demo doc (part 3): Try it out!

Let's run a regression.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(tvhours ~ age, data = gss_cat)
summary(m1)
```

Character strings and factors are automatically dummy-coded by `lm()`:

```{r}
m2 <- lm(tvhours ~ marital, data = gss_cat)
summary(m2)
```

**Try it out!**

Can you add another variable to the model? If you need to check what variables are in `gss_cat`, print that object to the console. What do you notice about the output?

```{r}
m3 <- lm(tvhours ~ age + , data = gss_cat)
summary(m3)
```
